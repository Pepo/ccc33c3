# Temporary rebrush for the 33C

I find it very unfortunate that the great design of  this yearâ€™s congress  is not reflected on the website of the CCC.

So I created a small upgrade to the normal CCC website layout.

# Install

- put the stylesheets/33c3stuff directory into the stylesheets directory on the web server
- add the file stylesheets/33c3stuff/additional_styles_for_33c3.css to every document, after the normal CCC CCS stuff
- be happy that the congress design is on the ccc page for the first time \o/

# There is no rebrush for the congress.
